# CE-Script-Compiler
A very simple python script with a GUI, to compile multiple Cheat Engine CT scripts into one big script. 

Useful for minimizing the amount of scripts you have and for making your lua script toggle's easier.

# NOTE:
This is a very old project that I haven't worked in years. Just thought I'd release it publicly if anyone wants to save some time compiling cheat engine trainers or whatever :)
